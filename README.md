To run the ipynb file, simply press run all for both 8-puzzle and missionaries-cannibals.

For the 8-puzzle problem, you have to enter the initial puzzle state and the goal puzzle state after pressing Run all
For example, if the initial puzzle state is 
7 2 4
5 0 6
8 3 1
and the goal state is 
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
Then you should input 724506831 for the initial state and 012345678 for the goal state.

if you are running the A start search, you have to input 'N' or 'M' for the A star heuristic after entering the initial and goal state,
'N' stands for number of misplaced and 'M' stands for manhattan distance.

For the missionaries-cannibals problem, you have to input 'D' for DFS or 'A' for A star Search after pressing Run all
Then the algorithm will display all the details.
